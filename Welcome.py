    This work study the reproducibility of wind speed and wind power
    capacity factor by the WRF mesoscale model. Simulations are compared
    with 22 masts of observations with a uniform configuration
    and methodology for a nation-wide analysis.

    The maps present seasonal means of wind speed for the domain of WRF at 1 km redolution.

    ### Contents
    - Maps of seasonal wind speeds.
    - Distribution of regions and stations.
